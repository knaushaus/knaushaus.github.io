Joan had one of those big white vans with a sliding side door. She had ripped out all the seats in the back and lived in it for a while the previous year with her boyfriend Darren. They slept on a futon mattress in the back and slept in parking lots up and down the east coast. But then it got too hot and they kept arguing about little shit, so Darren got a friend from Waltham to pick him up one night and he moved back in with his parents.

She moved into our place for a while then got a sublet in Medford. But she kept the van, and just dumped the mattress out in a parking lot and tried to set it on fire with her cigarette when we were all pretty drunk and driving around one night, but it wouldn't light. Which was probably for the best.

So there was nothing in the back of the van, and she kept it that way. She'd get really shitty if you were riding shotgun and threw a bottle in the back or whatever. She didn't keep it clean, really, but she kept the clutter out. She was driving us around in the van and we were looking for frat parties or whatever to crash for fun, "like the good old days," Paul said with a really serious look on his face and a really flat, angry voice. Joan laughed and asked him what the fuck he meant, and he just stared out the windshield while I squatted on the milk crate behind the two bucket seats up front. "It's like I said. Goin' out like the good old days," he said, and turned to look at some college kids we were passing. He pointed at his eyes with his two fingers, then pointed at the college kids through the window. "The good old days," he said. I had no idea what the fuck he was talking about, either, but I loved it all the same. We couldn't find any parties, or at least any that didn't look full of "little fuck-ups," as Paul said.
